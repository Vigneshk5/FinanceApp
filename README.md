# mern-financeApp
This is a Finance Dashboard application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) . The frontend is built with Vite as the starter application, Redux Toolkit for state management, Material UI for the component library, and Recharts for charts and data visualization. The backend utilizes Node.js as the runtime, Express.js as the backend framework, and MongoDB for the database.
